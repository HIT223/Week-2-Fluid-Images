Use this file as a place to write your responsive image rules
	- images should never be larger than their column

	Bonus: There are times when we don't want images to take up their entire column on smaller screens
	- images should never be larger than 70% of their column when on small screens (say 449px and smaller)
		- at this size, images should be centered within their column, tip: margins

Don't forget to have a look at the fluid_test.css file if your interested in the styles and media queries that make the layout change
